Currently I am  a last-year master student in Machine Intelligence Lab at Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). 
Prior to that,
I received my B.S.'s degree in computer science at Northwestern Polytechnical University. I visited [Image Process Group](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/) (directed by [Prof. Narciso Garc√≠a](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/narciso-garcia)) at Technical University of Madrid in Spain for 6 months, sponsored by China Scholarship Council.

My research interests are video understanding, image/video grounding and causal inference.
