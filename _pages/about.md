About Me
======
I am  currently a last-year master student in Machine Intelligence Lab at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). My research interests are video semantic analysis.

I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science from the School of Computer Science in Northwestern Polytechnical University. Sponsored by China Scholarship Council, I visited [Image Process Group](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/) (directed by [Prof. Narciso García](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/narciso-garcia)) at Technical University of Madrid, Spain for 6 months during my bachelor study
