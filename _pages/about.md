About Me
======
Currently I am a third-year master student in [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://www.muyadong.com/publication.html) at Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). 
Prior to that,
I received my B.S. degree in computer science at Northwestern Polytechnical University. I also visited [Image Process Group](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/) (directed by [Prof. Narciso García](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/narciso-garcia)) at Technical University of Madrid in Spain for 6 months, sponsored by China Scholarship Council.

My primary research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning problems in general.
Particularly, I am interested in video understanding, image/video grounding and causal inference.
