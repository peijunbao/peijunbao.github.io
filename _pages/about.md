About Me
======
Currently I am a third-year master student in Machine Intelligence Lab at Peking University (PKU), supervised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). 
Prior to that,
I received my B.S. degree in computer science at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). During my B.S. study, I visited Image Process Group (mentored by [Prof. Carlos R. del Blanco](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/carlos-r-del-blanco)) at Technical University of Madrid in Spain for 6 months, sponsored by China Scholarship Council. I was also a research assistant in Medical Image Processing Lab at NPU, mentored by [Prof. Yong Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Usw1jeMAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in the field of computer vision and machine learning problems. Particularly, I am interested in 
video understanding (classification, localization, grouding etc)
