About Me
======
I am  currently a last-year master student in Machine Intelligence Lab at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). My research interests are video semantic analysis.

I received my bachelor's degree in computer science at Northwestern Polytechnical University. During my bachelor study, I visited [Image Process Group](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/) (directed by [Prof. Narciso Garc√≠a](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/narciso-garcia)) at Technical University of Madrid in Spain for 6 months, sponsored by China Scholarship Council.
